# steamworks-meme

Big steamworks code, includes basic functionalities, setting rich presence, unlocking achievements.

It also has memory managment stuff now, for whatever reason

You will need to supply an appid for the game you're trying to meme, so create a text file in the same location as the executable
named "steam_appid.txt" and just put the ID in there, such as "440", or "730" without the quotation marks.
