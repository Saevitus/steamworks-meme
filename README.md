Big fucking steamworks meme, includes basic functionalities, setting rich presence, unlocking achievements.

You will need to supply an appid for the game you're trying to meme, so create a text file in the same location as the executable
named "steam_appid.txt" and just put the ID in there, such as "440", or "730" without the quotation marks.
